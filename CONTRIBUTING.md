# Contributing
When wishing to contribute please first contact one of the project maintainers. This project still has a WIP status,
and as such has issues which take priority over others.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

Be advised that we are using Ruby version 2.5.0.

To get started on the project locally, clone and bundle it.

## Workflow
1. Choose a ticket.
  Having chosen a ticket, create a branch locally. The branch name should start with the number of the ticket/issue i.e.
  `81-write-a-test`
2. Write a test.
  While we understand that not everyone writes using TDD, we insist on keeping a high level of test coverage in our
  project. If you add new code, please write a test.
3. Make sure the existing tests pass.
  Please make sure the existing tests pass
4. Create a Pull Request.
  Push your branch to our repo, and create a pull request. If you are ready for your code to be reviewed, please use
  the `Code Review` flag. Your pull request will then be reviewed. In your Pull Request, please state your steps for QA-ing
  your branch. This will make it clearer for those who review your pull request, and easier for you when you come to QA it.
5. Test your branch in our SandBox.
  Push your branch to our SandBox, and smoke test the application to make sure that everything still works as it should. Please also follow your own stated QA steps.
6. Merge your branch to master.
  Once your tests pass, your code has been reviewed and your branch successfully tested on our SandBox, then you can merge
  your branch to master.
